# TCP-IP Host

## Goals

- This is a program designed to host a TCP/IP server within C#.
- The reasoning that this program is useful is with basic synchronization, such as a timer, or other basic information.
  - Without this code, instead, we could also use a program called "Hercules" which supplies a TCP/IP Server, as well as UDP, and other protocols.
